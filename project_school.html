                        <h2>Various Writing Assignments & Works</h2>
                        <p>These are a few pieces written while attending school. I handpicked a few pieces, some simply being a weekly homework assignment, and some being more complete </p>
                        <h1>Editorial for HIS301: Historical Writing</h1>
                        <iframe class="iframe" src="Non-GIS/Editorial_HIS301.pdf" width="75%" height="1000px" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                        <p>The editorial is one of my most recent writings and was written for an assignment in my Historical Writing class. A part of our larger final paper, this editorial focused on the cultural importance of horses to native americans, with this piece specifically focusing on the Comanche and their relationship with the horse.
                        </p>
                        <h1>Response Paper on Brazilian Sugar Plantations & Slavery</h1>
                        <iframe class="iframe" src="Non-GIS/Paper2_HIS328.pdf" width="75%" height="1000px" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                        <p>Making up one of three papers written during the semester, this first paper for my History of Brazil class was on Andre Antonil’s Brazil at the Dawn of the Eighteenth Century, with my assignment focusing on his sections about sugar plantations and slavery in colonial Brazil. Antonil was a missionary and author who published his book in 1711, documenting everyday life and society in Brazil. Despite being a Jesuit missionary during a time in which slavery was practiced in Brazil and elsewhere, Antonil does an excellent job capturing the horrors of what being a sugar plantation slave entailed.

                        <h1>Assignment on the Importance of Placemaking in Buffalo</h1>
                        <iframe class="iframe" src="Non-GIS/END279_HW2.pdf" width="75%" height="1000px" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                        <p>This was a weekly assignment for my Exploring the Design of Buffalo-Niagara class, in which we were tasked to explore Buffalo and take several photos that relate to the placemaking of Buffalo.  A major component of the class was the idea of placemaking, which is essentially the principle of designing a city that improves on the overall wellbeing of its citizens, usually encompassing democratic practices to get community feedback and contribution in improving their city. Another aspect of placemaking is tying the local community’s identity to the city, which this particular assignment captures several examples of the local community’s identity being tied to the design of Buffalo.

                        <h1>Improving Urban Parking Module</h1>
                        <iframe class="iframe" src="Non-GIS/Module8_END285.pdf" width="75%" height="1000px" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                        <p>Another environmental design class assignment, this module was part of my online Transportation and Urban Life class. The focus of the short paper was on parking problems within the University at Buffalo, and some possible ideas to solve the prevalent issues the school faces.
