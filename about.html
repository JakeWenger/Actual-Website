                        <h1>A Little About Myself</h1>
                        <p>I am a graduate from the University at Buffalo, where I pursued and obtained a degree majoring in geographic info science and a minor in environmental design. Originally going to school for civil engineering, I decided to pursue my degree in geographic info science due to the numerous fields that utilize GIS to analyze everyday problems and provide solutions to those problems. I felt that as I grow as a person with time, I’d better be able to learn and flourish in my field more so than I could with civil engineering or another discipline. It’s the versatility in regards to applying GIS to another field that ultimately pulled me towards this career path.
                        </p>   
                        <p>Currently, I’ve begun searching for my first job within the discipline of geospatial science, having moved and settled into the Phoenix area fairly recently. Although filled with a sense of nervousness, to a greater extent I’m filled with excitement at the thought of truly starting down my post-graduate path. 
                        </p>

                        <img src="images/Chlo.jpg" alt="Jake & Chloe" width="20%" height="20%">
                        <p>I spent the first 23 years of my life on Long Island before moving out west to the greater Phoenix area. Rather than job hunting right after I graduated from Buffalo, I began to work on this website or ePortfolio to better show off any skills I have to potential employers. I also resumed my old job at TCBY and helped my dad prepare for our eventual move to reunite with my mom, who had been living in Scottsdale since June of 2019 due to increasing fibromyalgia pain. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Outside of geospatial science, my interests and hobbies include playing video games, especially games that are strategy-driven or have an open-world element to them. I've also become an advert biker since moving into the Northern Phoenix area, as I only live a few minutes from the canal trail and the Reach 11 recreational area. Being interested mainly in American football with some interest in baseball, I’ve been a lifelong Giants and Yankees fan, though I always love rooting for all the hometown teams (whether it be New York or now Arizona).
