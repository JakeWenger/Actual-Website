                        <p>
                            The Reach 11 Trail Mapping Project is a data collecting task I started working on back in September 2021. My first goal for the project was to collect data on all traversable trail paths, trail entrances, markers, info boards, and other various attributes of Reach 11 into a dataset utilizing the ArcGIS QuickCapture application. The second and final goal of the project was to create a finalized, static map of the Reach 11 Recreational Park – however as the project progressed, I instead focused on creating a static map of the western and eastern portions of the park respectively. Since Reach 11 is such a large park, trying to fit the entire dataset into a small frame would render the map useless in readability, so I decided to split the park into two maps. This is the same reason I decided to only include traversable paths, trail markers, park entrances, and info boards in the final static maps despite collecting other types of observations.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I decided to pursue this project for a few reasons. One was to demonstrate my ability to collect and create data, as well as being able to make a map (or maps) from my own dataset. This was my first time utilizing ESRI’s QuickCapture app, so I wanted to show that I can explore and learn new skills and software on my own. Furthermore, I wanted to get acquainted with ArcGIS Pro, as my curriculum at the SUNY University at Buffalo utilized ArcMap over ArcGIS Pro - despite both GIS software programs being very similar to one another.

                        </div>
                        <p>
                            QuickCapture was very vital for this project. After watching and following a few online guides, I was able to create my own “form” through ArcGIS Online for data collection in the field using the QuickCapture mobile app. This allowed me to collect point, line and polygon data with relative ease while in Reach 11 - the only drawback was any changes that needed to be made to the form (ie. creating a new observation type for trail markers of the Barrier Free Nature Trail) could only be made through ArcGIS Online and not through the mobile application itself. Besides being able to collect data on-the-go, the accuracy of the data being collected was quite accurate considering I was using a mobile phone for data collection.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The QuickCapture application automatically sets up a datatable for each new project you set up online, automatically storing and organizing any data you collect and upload to ArcGIS Online. This made it very easy to collect data, have it uploaded to the datatable, and then be able to download the dataset for use in ArcGIS Pro or other mapping programs. In addition, when using a dataset that’s linked to ArcGIS Online in an ArcGIS Pro project on your desktop, that dataset will be automatically updated if new data is collected and added to the dataset. And you can also add any pieces of data that you may have missed in the field in ArcGIS Pro, which will then automatically update your dataset for future use - this was actually what I did for a trail entrance I knew existed but I had forgotten to collect while in Reach 11.

                        <p>
                            Through Map Viewer, I was able to create an interactive map of the raw data I collected by creating a view-only layer and using that to make my interactive map. The map was made partly for validating the collection of data when I was in Reach 11, since the map would update whenever I uploaded collected data. I would use the map to make sure I wasn’t recording the same attribute multiple times - which helped me to avoid mapping multiple instances of several trail post markings on the trail stretch between the 101 and 51 junction, for example. The map was also created in part for display purposes for the portfolio, providing a visualization of the data that was collected for this project.

                        <p>
                            After I had completed the data collection part of my project, the only thing I had left besides creating feature classes of each attribute that would be used in the final maps - and making the final maps themselves - was creating a shapefile of all traversable trail paths from the various routes I had recorded in the field. While I could have simply used the line data I had recorded and uploaded to ArcGIS Online, creating a shapefile from that same data allowed me to create a polished, finalized feature class of all traversable paths in Reach 11.

                        </div>
                        <p>
                            Once I had everything I needed to create my static maps, I started a new layout in ArcGIS Pro to create the finalized static map you see above. I made sure to try to stay true to the conforms of good map design (central title, legend-key, scale bar, etc.), and I also included an overview map to make it easier to determine where Reach 11 is located within the greater metropolitan area of Phoenix. I repeated the process I had done for the map of the western park portion to make the second map of the eastern park portion.
