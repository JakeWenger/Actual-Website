                        <h1>Rodent Incidence in Buffalo</h1>
                        <p style="text-align: center;"><iframe height="500" width="900" frameborder="0" src="rodents.html" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
                        <p>Originally created in my Cartography & Geographic Visualization class, this is a choropleth map depicting the varying number of rodents found per census tract
                            in the city of Buffalo. The map version seen above is a recreated file using the original data and steps, as the original chortopleth map had a few errors I
                            wasn't able to identify at first in regards to the map's interactivity. However, through troubleshooting and some patience I managed to identify any mistakes made 
                            in the original web map to create a fully finished form, as seen above.

                            For this project, we utilized rodent census tract data given to us in class and the online webmapping service Mapbox (in addition to HTML coding) to create an
                            interactive choropleth map. Simply by uploading the GEOjson file, I was able to bring the uploaded data into a preset styleized map provided by Mapbox, and by 
                            selecting the "incidence" field and create breaks using Jenks natural breaks method, I was able to create a choropleth map representing the varying incidence levels 
                            of rats throughout the city of Buffalo.

                            While the base map and data visualization were made in Mapbox Studio, the rest of the project was done via HTML coding. We utilized HTML to create the info box
                            in the top right corner, the legend in the bottom right, and most importantly HTML was used to create the interactivity function of the map. The callback function
                            is what makes the hover function work, which forbids to entire code from being executed upon loading in the map - only when an event occurs (in this case hovering over 
                            a tract) will the additional code be executed.

                        <h1>Simple Proportional Symbol Map</h1>
                        <p style="text-align: center;"><iframe height="500" width="900" frameborder="0" src="propsymbols.html" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
                        <p>Related to the interactive choropleth map above, this map was made in QGIS and Mapbox, and depicts the number of rodent incidence rates per council district, rather than 
                            census tracts as in the other map. The map is a simple proportional symbol map, meaning a larger dot indicates a district with high rodent incidence, while smaller dots 
                            represent districts with lower incidenct rates. Proportional maps are also known as Graduated Point maps, since the points or symbols <i>graduate</i> in size and intensity
                            with regards to the data being mapped and visualized.

                            QGIS was used to bring in the CSV file containing the rodent incidence data in order to create the graduated points layer. This new file was then brought into Mapbox 
                            along with the council district data in a pre-made map style to visually represent the council district boundaries with the corresponding rodent incidence points.

                        <p>Another project revolving around the use of JavaScript to create an interactive map, the map above utilized data from <i>OpenData - Buffalo</i> to create an interactive
                           webmap that not only shows each individual vacant lot, but it also allows the user to click on each lot to see the sale price. The focus of this assignment was to introduce us 
                           to Leaflet, one of JavaScript's most popular open-source libraries used for creating webmaps such as the one above. Although we didn't go further into learning about Leaflet,

                        <p>This map depicts every county that makes up the United States (excluding territories), featuring interactivity that allows the user to hover over any county to reveal its
                            name. Through the Data Driven Documents (D3) library, this particular assignment utilized JavaScript to demonstrate another way in which interactive webmapping can be 
                            accomplished. Besides introducing us to a new approach on webmapping, the reason D3 has been utilized for webmapping is because it offers those with less coding experience
                            an easier way to create a visually-pleasing map.
