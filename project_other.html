                        <h1>NFL Stadium Proportional Symbol Map</h1>
                        <p style="text-align: center";><iframe height="500" width="900" frameborder="0" src="NFL_Stadiums.html" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
                        <p>The goal I set forth for this mini project was to create a proportional symbol map of all 32 NFL teams' stadiums, with the symbols being
                            proportional to the average home game attendance. These values for average home attendance percentage can be found online, but I also had to include
                            other pieces of information in the dataset - such as the stadium max capacity and the average home attendance - and because I had to make the 
                            dataset myself instead of downloading an opensource dataset, I instead calculated my own average attendance percentage values through Excel with
                            the data I had collected.
                        </p>            
                        <p>Although the map does a solid job in expressing stadium location and average attendance values, there are a few asteriks to note. First, the data 
                            comes from the 2019 NFL season, as the 2020 season was greatly impacted by COVID. Despite COVID having an affect, I decided to represent al the current
                            NFL stadium locations on the map. This means that although the Las Vegas Raiders now play at Allegiant Stadium (as shown on the map), the attendance data 
                            is NOT for Allegiant Stadium and is for Oakland Colesium, since the Raiders moved permanently to Vegas for the 2020 season with no fans in attendance.
                        </p>        
                        <p>This also means that the attendance data for the Rams corresponds to 2019 attendance data of LA Memorial Coliseum, the Chargers 2019 data corresponds to 
                            attendance at Dignity Park - which is also represented as both the Rams and Chargers now play at SoFi stadium, and I wanted the data to be more visible (no multiple
                            data-points on the same spot). Lastly, since both the Giants and Jets play at MetLife and I myself am a longtime Giants fan, I put the rightful team's data
                            point on top of MetLife, with the other team's data point located in the adjacent parking lot.
