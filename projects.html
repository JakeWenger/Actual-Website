                        <h1>Past University Works - GIS</h1>
                        <p>Here I have showcased some projects that were conducted during my time attending college, some being simple static maps and some
                            being more complex and having interactivity. These are the works I feel best showcase what I've learned and accomplished attending the 
                            University at Buffalo.
                        </p>

                        <h1>Independent Works</h1>
                        <p>These are the completed maps I've made since graduating. They're purely informational and serve little purpose other than to work on developing
                            my skill set, and strengthening the skills I already have learned.
                        </p>

                        <h1>Other University Works</h1>
                        <p>Although these are also a collection of works done during college, this page showcases works done for either the Environmental Design minor or 
                            were non-GIS related coursework that I felt could be beneficial in uploading onto the website.
